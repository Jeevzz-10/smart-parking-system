## 🔧 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1. Database Setup

1.  Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
2.  Open your MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench) and run the `smart_parking_final.sql` file (the one with the `CREATE TABLE` statements) to create the database schema.
3.  Next, run the `smart_parking_logic_v4.sql` file (or the latest version) to create all the necessary stored procedures, functions, and triggers.

### 2. Python Environment

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-github-repo-url>
    cd smart-parking-project
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Configure Credentials

1.  Create a new folder named `.streamlit` in the project's root directory.
2.  Inside this folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
3.  Add your MySQL credentials to this file. **(This file is in .gitignore and should NOT be pushed to GitHub)**.

    ```toml
    # .streamlit/secrets.toml

    [mysql]
    host = "localhost"
    user = "your_mysql_user"
    password = "your_mysql_password"
    database = "smart_parking_final"
    ```

### 4. Run the Application

Once your database is set up and your `secrets.toml` file is in place, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
